# Rubicon assignment TMDB app

## Built with React

### [Live demo](https://rubicon-tmdb.vercel.app)

Test the app in development mode:

`yarn start`

Build the app :

`yarn build`

After building the app there are several ways to serve it. For example:

`npx serve build`

### Note to Rubicon:

In the assignment you said to show a trailer if one exists instead of the cover image in detailed view. I checked over a hundred movies and shows, none of which had a video. I didn't put it in because I had no way of testing it. Implementing it would be fairly simple though using conditional rendering.
